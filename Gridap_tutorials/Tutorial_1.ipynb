    "## 1. Setting Up the Julia Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start working with Gridap.jl, we need to properly set up our Julia environment. This involves two critical steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Activating the Project Environment \n",
    "```julia\n",
    "Pkg.activate(\"..\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you activate a project environment, Julia switches from the global package registry to a **local project-specific environment**. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: The project uses the exact package versions specified in `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Changes to packages in this project won't affect other Julia projects on your system\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Everyone working on this tutorial will use the same package versions, avoiding \"works on my machine\" issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\"..\"` argument tells Julia to activate the environment in the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Instantiating the Environment\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "Pkg.instantiate()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `instantiate()` command ensures all required packages are installed with their correct versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downloads missing packages**: If any packages specified in `Project.toml` are not installed, they will be downloaded\n",
    "- **Resolves dependencies**: Ensures all package dependencies are compatible and available\n",
    "- **Builds packages**: Compiles any binary dependencies that packages might need\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as similar to `npm install` (Node.js), `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Python), or `maven install` (Java).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You only need to run `instantiate()` once when you first clone or download this tutorial. After that, simply activating the environment is sufficient, unless the package dependencies change."

    "## 2. Creating a Computational Domain with Cartesian Meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "In finite element analysis, the first step is to discretize our computational domain into a mesh. Gridap.jl provides the `CartesianDiscreteModel` function to create structured Cartesian meshes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Understanding the Domain Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain Definition**: `domain = (0, L, 0, L)`\n",
    "   - Defines a square domain from $(0,0)$ to $(L,L)$ in 2D space\n",
    "   - The tuple format is `(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)`\n",
    "   - For our example, with `L = 2.0`, we create a $2.0 \\times 2.0$ square\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mesh Partition**: `partition = (n, n)`\n",
    "   - Specifies how many cells to create in each direction\n",
    "   - With `n = 2`, we divide the domain into $2 \\times 2 = 4$ square cells\n",
    "   - Each cell will have dimensions $\\frac{L}{n} \\times \\frac{L}{n} = 1.0 \\times 1.0$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating the Model**: `model = CartesianDiscreteModel(domain, partition)`\n",
    "   - Generates the discrete model containing:\n",
    "     - **Nodes (vertices)**: $(n+1) \\times (n+1) = 9$ nodes in our case\n",
    "     - **Cells (elements)**: $n \\times n = 4$ quadrilateral elements\n",
    "     - **Boundary tags**: Automatically labels domain boundaries for applying boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Visualization with VTK\n",
    "\n",
    "The `writevtk(model, \"model\")` function exports the mesh to VTK format:\n",
    "- Creates files `model_0.vtu`, `model_1.vtu`, `model_2.vtu` (for different topological dimensions)\n",
    "- These files can be visualized using [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) or other VTK-compatible software\n",
    "- Useful for inspecting the mesh quality and structure before solving\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📘 Note**: Cartesian meshes are ideal for rectangular domains and provide uniform element sizes, which is excellent for learning and debugging. For more complex geometries, Gridap also supports unstructured meshes imported from external mesh generators (like GMSH)."

    "## 3. Defining Reference Finite Elements and Finite Element Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the mesh, we need to define the **finite element spaces** where our solution will live. This involves two key concepts: the reference finite element and the function spaces built from it.\n",

    "### 3.1 Reference Finite Element\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "reffe = ReferenceFE(lagrangian, Float64, 1)\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`lagrangian`**: Specifies Lagrangian (nodal) interpolation\n",
    "  - Basis functions have the property $\\phi_i(x_j) = \\delta_{ij}$ (Kronecker delta)\n",
    "  - Values at nodes directly correspond to degrees of freedom\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`Float64`**: The data type for storing values (double precision floating point)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`1`**: The polynomial order of the basis functions\n",
    "  - Order 1 = linear elements (straight edges, planar faces)\n",
    "  - For 2D quadrilaterals, this gives bilinear basis functions\n",
    "  - Each element will have 4 nodes (one at each corner)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Test Function Space (V)\n",

    "- **`reffe`**: Uses the reference element defined above\n",
    "- **`conformity=:H1`**: Ensures functions are continuous across element boundaries\n",
    "  - $H^1$ conformity means $u \\in H^1(\\Omega)$: functions with square-integrable derivatives\n",
    "  - Essential for problems involving gradients (like our Poisson equation)\n",
    "- **`dirichlet_tags=\"boundary\"`**: Identifies where to apply Dirichlet boundary conditions\n",
    "  - Tags all nodes on the domain boundary\n",
    "  - These will be treated as constrained degrees of freedom\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`V`**: Inherits structure from the test space\n",
    "- **`x -> x[1]`**: Boundary condition function\n",
    "  - For each point `x` on the boundary, sets $u = x_1$ (the x-coordinate)\n",
    "  - This creates a non-homogeneous Dirichlet condition: $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1$ on $\\partial\\Omega$\n",
    "  - Interior nodes remain free (unknowns to solve for)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Galerkin Method Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Galerkin finite element method:\n",
    "- **Trial functions** ($u \\in U$): Satisfy the boundary conditions and represent candidate solutions\n",
    "- **Test functions** ($v \\in V$): Satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions ($v = 0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$) and are used to form the weak formulation\n",
    "\n",

    "## 9. Evaluating Weak Forms with Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we dive into the assembly process by evaluating our weak forms using the basis functions directly. This reveals what happens under the hood when Gridap assembles the system matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Computing Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "matcontrib = a(u_basis, v_basis)  # Matrix contributions\n",
    "veccontrib = l(v_basis)            # Vector contributions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluate the bilinear and linear forms with basis functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix contributions** (`matcontrib`):\n",
    "- Evaluates $a(\\phi_j, \\psi_i)$ for all pairs of trial ($\\phi_j$) and test ($\\psi_i$) basis functions\n",
    "- Results in element stiffness matrices for each cell\n",
    "- For our problem: $a(\\phi_j, \\psi_i) = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\nabla \\psi_i \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_j \\, d\\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector contributions** (`veccontrib`):\n",
    "- Evaluates $l(\\psi_i)$ for all test basis functions\n",
    "- Results in element load vectors for each cell  \n",
    "- For our problem: $l(\\psi_i) = \\int_{\\Omega_e} f \\, \\psi_i \\, d\\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 The Assembly Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The contributions are computed **element-by-element**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop over cells**: For each element $\\Omega_e$ in the mesh\n",
    "2. **Local integration**: Compute element matrix $\\mathbf{K}^e$ and vector $\\mathbf{f}^e$\n",
    "3. **Assembly mapping**: Determine which global DoFs correspond to local element nodes\n",
    "4. **Accumulation**: Add element contributions to global system\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3 Collecting Cell Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "data = collect_cell_matrix_and_vector(U, V, matcontrib, veccontrib, uhd)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function collects the element-wise data:\n",
    "- **Cell matrices**: Local stiffness matrices $\\mathbf{K}^e$ for each element\n",
    "- **Cell vectors**: Local load vectors $\\mathbf{f}^e$ for each element\n",
    "- **Assembly indices**: Mappings from local to global DoF numbering\n",
    "- **Boundary data**: Contributions from fixed DoFs (from `uhd`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.4 Why This is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the element-by-element assembly reveals:\n",
    "- How local computations on simple reference elements build the global system\n",
    "- The source of matrix sparsity (local support of basis functions)\n",
    "- How boundary conditions affect the assembly\n",
    "- Where computational cost comes from in FEM\n",
    "\n",
    "This level of detail is typically hidden in high-level FEM codes, but Gridap exposes it for users who want to understand or customize the assembly process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📘 Note**: The next code cell will examine the actual numerical values of these element contributions, showing the concrete matrices and vectors computed during assembly."
