    "## 1. Setting Up the Julia Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start working with Gridap.jl, we need to properly set up our Julia environment. This involves two critical steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Activating the Project Environment \n",
    "```julia\n",
    "Pkg.activate(\"..\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you activate a project environment, Julia switches from the global package registry to a **local project-specific environment**. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: The project uses the exact package versions specified in `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Changes to packages in this project won't affect other Julia projects on your system\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Everyone working on this tutorial will use the same package versions, avoiding \"works on my machine\" issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\"..\"` argument tells Julia to activate the environment in the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Instantiating the Environment\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "Pkg.instantiate()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `instantiate()` command ensures all required packages are installed with their correct versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downloads missing packages**: If any packages specified in `Project.toml` are not installed, they will be downloaded\n",
    "- **Resolves dependencies**: Ensures all package dependencies are compatible and available\n",
    "- **Builds packages**: Compiles any binary dependencies that packages might need\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as similar to `npm install` (Node.js), `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Python), or `maven install` (Java).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You only need to run `instantiate()` once when you first clone or download this tutorial. After that, simply activating the environment is sufficient, unless the package dependencies change."

    "## 2. Creating a Computational Domain with Cartesian Meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "In finite element analysis, the first step is to discretize our computational domain into a mesh. Gridap.jl provides the `CartesianDiscreteModel` function to create structured Cartesian meshes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Understanding the Domain Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain Definition**: `domain = (0, L, 0, L)`\n",
    "   - Defines a square domain from $(0,0)$ to $(L,L)$ in 2D space\n",
    "   - The tuple format is `(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)`\n",
    "   - For our example, with `L = 2.0`, we create a $2.0 \\times 2.0$ square\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mesh Partition**: `partition = (n, n)`\n",
    "   - Specifies how many cells to create in each direction\n",
    "   - With `n = 2`, we divide the domain into $2 \\times 2 = 4$ square cells\n",
    "   - Each cell will have dimensions $\\frac{L}{n} \\times \\frac{L}{n} = 1.0 \\times 1.0$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating the Model**: `model = CartesianDiscreteModel(domain, partition)`\n",
    "   - Generates the discrete model containing:\n",
    "     - **Nodes (vertices)**: $(n+1) \\times (n+1) = 9$ nodes in our case\n",
    "     - **Cells (elements)**: $n \\times n = 4$ quadrilateral elements\n",
    "     - **Boundary tags**: Automatically labels domain boundaries for applying boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Visualization with VTK\n",
    "\n",
    "The `writevtk(model, \"model\")` function exports the mesh to VTK format:\n",
    "- Creates files `model_0.vtu`, `model_1.vtu`, `model_2.vtu` (for different topological dimensions)\n",
    "- These files can be visualized using [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) or other VTK-compatible software\n",
    "- Useful for inspecting the mesh quality and structure before solving\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📘 Note**: Cartesian meshes are ideal for rectangular domains and provide uniform element sizes, which is excellent for learning and debugging. For more complex geometries, Gridap also supports unstructured meshes imported from external mesh generators (like GMSH)."

    "  - This creates a non-homogeneous Dirichlet condition: $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1$ on $\\partial\\Omega$\n",
    "  - Interior nodes remain free (unknowns to solve for)\n",

    "### 3.4 Galerkin Method Structure\n",

    "In the Galerkin finite element method:\n",
    "- **Trial functions** ($u \\in U$): Satisfy the boundary conditions and represent candidate solutions\n",

    "The sign convention for indices serves a crucial purpose:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding the element-by-element computation reveals:\n",
    "- How local computations on simple reference elements build the global system\n",
    "- The source of matrix sparsity (local support of basis functions)\n",
    "- How boundary conditions affect the elemental vectors\n",
    "- Where computational cost comes from in FEM\n",
    "- The role of the sign convention in handling constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "This level of detail is typically hidden in high-level FEM codes, but Gridap exposes it for users who want to understand or customize the process from weak forms to elemental contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows:\n",
    "- **Parallel assembly**: Different cells can be processed independently to compute elemental contributions\n",
    "- **Sparse matrix construction**: Only non-zero positions are touched\n",
    "- **Boundary condition handling**: The sign convention elegantly encodes constraints in the elemental data\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Same structure works for different element types and problem sizes\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: No need to store separate arrays for free and fixed DoFs\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📘 Note**: In Gridap, this elemental data structure is exposed for educational purposes. In practice, Gridap's high-level interface handles assembly automatically, but understanding the elemental level helps when implementing custom assembly routines or debugging. The next code cell will examine the actual numerical values of these elemental contributions."

    "$$K^e_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j \\, d\\Omega$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetry**: $K^e$ should be symmetric because the bilinear form $a(u,v) = \\int \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v$ is symmetric\n",
    "2. **Positive semi-definite**: All diagonal entries should be positive\n",
    "3. **Row sums**: For our Laplacian operator with constant coefficients, row sums relate to discrete conservation properties\n",
    "4. **Order of magnitude**: For a $1 \\times 1$ element, entries should be $O(1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Values**:\n",

    "- Diagonal: $\\approx 0.667$\n",
    "- Off-diagonal (adjacent nodes): $\\approx -0.167$ or $\\approx -0.333$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Elemental Load Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The elemental load vector entries **before applying boundary conditions** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^e_i = \\int_{\\Omega_e} f \\cdot N_i \\, d\\Omega$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With constant source term $f = 1.0$ and element area $A_e = 1.0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^e_i = \\int_{\\Omega_e} N_i \\, d\\Omega = \\frac{A_e}{4} = 0.25$$\n",

    "For a pure elemental load vector (without boundary conditions), we would expect: $f^e = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**, the elemental vector we extract includes the effects of **Dirichlet boundary conditions** from `uhd`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^e_{\\text{modified},i} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} f \\cdot N_i \\, d\\Omega - \\sum_{j \\in \\text{fixed}} K^e_{ij} \\cdot u^{BC}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u^{BC}_j$ are the prescribed boundary values.\n",

    "\n",
    "These values differ from $[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]^T$ because:\n",
    "1. The element has nodes on the boundary with prescribed values $u = x_1$\n",
    "2. Contributions from $K^e_{ij} \\cdot u^{BC}_j$ are subtracted from the elemental load vector\n",
    "3. The resulting elemental vector is what gets assembled into the global right-hand side\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the values are not uniform—they account for the work done by boundary conditions!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting How Elemental Contributions Map to Global System\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rows` and `cols` arrays tell us how this element's contributions map to the global system. **Crucially, negative values indicate fixed degrees of freedom** (Dirichlet boundary conditions):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sign Convention**:\n",
    "- **Positive index** (e.g., `5`): Free DoF → elemental contribution goes to system matrix $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "- **Negative index** (e.g., `-4`): Fixed DoF → elemental contribution moves to right-hand side $\\mathbf{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example for Cell 3**:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "rows[3] = [1, -2, 3, -4]  # Hypothetical example\n",
    "cols[3] = [1, -2, 3, -4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Local nodes 1 and 3 correspond to **free** global DoFs 1 and 3\n",
    "- Local nodes 2 and 4 correspond to **fixed** global DoFs 2 and 4 (on boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assembly Logic for Elemental Contributions**:\n",
    "- **Free-Free** contributions (`rows[i] > 0` and `cols[j] > 0`): \n",
    "  - Go into system matrix: $A[i,j] += K^e_{ij}$\n",
    "- **Free-Fixed** contributions (`rows[i] > 0` and `cols[j] < 0`):\n",
    "  - Move to RHS: $b[i] -= K^e_{ij} \\cdot u_{\\text{fixed}}[|j|]$\n",
    "- **Fixed-Fixed** and **Fixed-Free** contributions: Not assembled (boundary conditions enforced directly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Our Problem**:\n",
    "With only node 5 free (the center node) and all boundary nodes fixed:\n",
    "- Only elemental contributions connecting node 5 to itself enter matrix $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "- Elemental contributions connecting node 5 to boundary nodes modify vector $\\mathbf{b}$\n",
    "- This explains why we get a $1 \\times 1$ global system despite having 4 elements with $4 \\times 4$ elemental matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verification Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining the elemental matrix and vector output, verify:\n",
    "- ✓ Is $K^e$ symmetric?\n",
    "- ✓ Are diagonal entries positive?\n",
    "- ✓ Do values match expected order of magnitude?\n",
    "- ✓ Do row/column indices correspond to the correct global DoFs?\n",
    "- ✓ Are negative indices present for boundary nodes?\n",
    "- ✓ Does the sign pattern match the problem's boundary conditions?\n",
    "- ✓ Does the elemental load vector $f^e$ differ from the pure load case due to boundary condition contributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Elemental Load Vector Sum**: The sum $\\sum f^e_i$ will NOT equal $f \\cdot A_e$ when boundary conditions are applied. In our case: $0.583 + 0.417 + 0.417 - 0.417 = 1.0$, which equals the area, but the individual components are modified by the boundary condition terms $-K^e_{ij} \\cdot u^{BC}_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📘 Note**: These elemental-level computations are performed on the reference element $[0,1]^2$ and then transformed to the physical element. The Jacobian determinant (which equals the element area for affine mappings) appears in the integration, giving the correct physical units. The negative index convention is a clever way to encode constraints without additional data structures. The elemental load vector values reflect both the source term AND the boundary condition contributions, which is why they differ from the uniform $[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]^T$ we would expect for a pure elemental vector without boundary conditions."
