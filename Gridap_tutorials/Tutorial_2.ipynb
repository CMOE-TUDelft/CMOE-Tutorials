    "# Tutorial 2: Introduction to Gridap.jl - Integration of elemental matrix and vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second tutorial in the CMOE series on computational methods for multiphysics problems! In this tutorial, you will explore **the numerical integration process** that transforms weak formulations into elemental matrices and vectors in Gridap.jl.\n",

    "> **📘 About this tutorial**: While Tutorial 1 covered the finite element workflow from weak forms to elemental matrix calculation, this tutorial focuses on what happens **inside the integration step**. We'll dissect the `integrate` function, examine quadrature rules, understand reference vs physical domain evaluations, and explore Gridap's lazy evaluation strategies. This is essential for understanding how Gridap achieves both mathematical elegance and computational efficiency.\n",
